<h1><a name=introduction>Introduction</a></h1>



<p>This document is a concise reference to grammar for people who are 
learning the spoken arabic of Egypt.</p>



      
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
This 

document


 is made up of three main sections: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>essentials - an introduction to grammatical terms and to Egyptian arabic, 
pointing out the similarities and differences between Egyptian and English</li>
<li>grammar - a description of how to build sentences using the standard language elements</li>
<li>usage - commonly used words, phrases and expressions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you just want to learn a few useful phrases like "Hello" and "How are you?", 
you can skip to the <a href='courtesies.html'>Courtesies</a> chapter, however it 
will make a lot more sense to you if you read the earlier chapters first.</p>

<h2>A word about arabic writing</h2>

<p>It is not difficult to learn to read and write in arabic, but it is 
an additional barrier to learning. You are unlikely ever to 
see Egyptian Arabic in print: notices, packaging, adverts, web sites etc are 
written in Modern Standard Arabic. And if you want to read Arabic handwriting, 
that's a different ballgame altogether. An understanding of the Arabic alphabet 
can, therefore, be useful, but it is by no means essential.</p>







<p>The examples in this document are therefore written in both arabic and roman 
letters. There are two ways of writing arabic using roman letters: the transliterated form
tells you exactly how it would be written in arabic, and the pronounced form 
gives you an indication of how to pronounce it. For the pronounced form, I have 
chosen to write things how and English person would. My apologies to people 
whose first language is not English.</p>








<p>The pronunciation rules, the arabic alphabet and the transliterated and 
pronounced spelling are explained in the section on <a href="arabic.html">arabic 
writing and pronunciation</a>
</p>





<p>You can hear most of the examples by clicking on the 
<img src="images/play.png"> button next to the example.
</p>







<p>You can select whether you want to see the examples in either transliterated 
or pronounced form, and you can select whether you wish to see it also in 
arabic writing. You can control these options using the buttons at the start of 
each chapter.
</p>

<p>You can also use the following keys:</p>
</p>
 
<ul>
<li>a - show/hide arabic</li>
<li>p - show pronounced</li>
<li>t - show transliterated</li>
</ul>
